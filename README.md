# robo-base
A base project for creating an easily-deployable WebApp using [RoboJS](https://robojs.dev/).

> Note: This README provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and deploying a RoboJS WebApp using the `main` branch.  

> For a fully implemented example showcasing additional RoboJS features, see the `sync-web-app` branch. That branch is referenced multiple times in this README as it contains simple bug functional examples of the features discussed here. It can also be used as a starting point for your own project.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v22 or newer
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://console.cloud.google.com/) account and [GCP CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) (for deployment)

## Setup

> Only required if you are starting a new project using the `main` branch.

1. Fork this repository or use it as a template for your own project.

2. Clone your repository to your computer and navigate to its directory.

3. Create a new project using the RoboJS CLI. Replace `<projectName>` with your desired project name:
   ```bash
   npx create-robo <projectName> && mv <projectName>/* . ; rmdir -r <projectName>
   ```

4. Select *Web Application* as the project type.

5. Enable the following features for the project:
   - *TypeScript*
   - *React*
   - *Prettier*
   - *ESLint*
   > See linting documentation [here](https://robojs.dev/robojs/linting).

   > The *opinionated* configuration of *Prettier* and *ESLint* is bundled with this project. You can remove it or customize it later if needed by altering the `.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore` and `eslint.config.mjs` files.

6. Enable *Sync* if your project requires state synchronization between clients.

   > For more details, see the [Synchronization of State between Clients](#synchronization-of-state-between-clients) section.

> At the end, you may see a few warnings about moving files after running the command. These can be safely ignored.

### Configuring Path Aliases

> Only reqiored if you are starting a new project using the `main` branch.

To avoid having to use relative paths in your imports, you can set up path aliases for your project. This allows you to use non-relative imports like `import { MyComponent } from '@/components/MyComponent'` instead of `import { MyComponent } from '../../components/MyComponent'`.

1. In `tsconfig.json`, update `compilerOptions`:
     ```jsonc
     {
       "compilerOptions": {
         // ...existing code...
         "baseUrl": ".",
         "paths": {
           "@/*": ["src/*"]
         }
       }
     }
     ```

2. In `config/vite.mjs`, under `resolve.alias`:
     ```javascript
     import path from 'path'
     // ...existing code...
     resolve: {
       alias: {
         '@': path.resolve(__dirname, '../src')
       }
     }
     ```

> You can see an example of this in [this commit](https://github.com/guplem/robo-base/commit/99f6a70849d39d664121a4b1b75453178a64015c).

### Environment Variables

You can create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project to set environment variables. This file is ignored by Git, so it won't be pushed to your repository.

The default `.env` file created by the RoboJS CLI contains the following variables:
```dotenv
# Enable source maps for easier debugging
NODE_OPTIONS="--enable-source-maps"

# Change this port number if needed
PORT="3000"
```

## Development Mode and Local Hosting

Start the development server with hot reloading:

> Make sure you have run `npm install` before starting the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

After running the command:
- The server will start at `http://localhost:3000/`.
- An external tunnel will be created (the URL will appear in the console). This allows you to test on other devices or share the server with others.

> If you want to run it using Docker, you can use `docker build -t robo-app .; docker run -p 3000:3000 robo-app`.

## Deployment

### Google Cloud

This project is pre-configured for automatic deployment to Google Cloud Run using a custom build process defined in `cloudbuild.yaml`.

1. In the file located at `config\plugins\robojs\server.ts`, add the `hostname` parameter to the server configuration with the value `0.0.0.0`:
   ```typescript
   export default {
      cors: true,
      hostname: '0.0.0.0'
      // other options...
   }
   ``` 

2. Update the `_SERVICE_NAME` variable in the `cloudbuild.yaml` file (under the *substitutions* section) to a recognizable name. This name will be used to create the Cloud Run service (e.g., "project-name-service").

3. Create a new project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).

4. Select the project in the top bar of the GCP console.

5. Enable the [Artifact Registry API](https://console.cloud.google.com/artifacts).

6. Install the [GCP CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and verify the installation:
   ```bash
   gcloud --version
   ```

7. Log in to your GCP account:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth login
   ```

8. Set the project ID in your terminal:
   ```bash
   gcloud config set project <project-id>
   ```
   > You can find the project ID in the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome).

9. Create a repository in Artifact Registry:
   ```bash
   gcloud artifacts repositories create cloud-run-source-deploy --repository-format=docker --location=europe-southwest1 --description="Docker repository for Cloud Run deployments"
   ```

   > You can change the location to your preferred region. The example above uses `europe-southwest1`.

10. Enable the [Cloud Build Triggers API](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers).

11. Create a Cloud Build trigger:
   - Click "Connect Repository".
   - Link your GitHub account to GCP and grant access to the repository by selecting "*Edit repositories on GitHub*".
   - After selecting the repository, choose *Create a trigger*.
   - Set a name (e.g., "project-name-deploy").
   - In the *Source* section, specify the branch to trigger builds from (the default is `main`).
   - In the *Configuration* section, choose "Cloud Build configuration file (YAML or JSON)".
   - Set the location to *Repository* and the path to `cloudbuild.yaml` (this is probably already set by default).
   - Select a service account.
   - Click "Create".

12. Set up the service account with the necessary permissions:
   - Go to the [IAM & Admin](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam) page.
   - Find the service account you selected in the previous step (it should have a name like `something@something.gserviceaccount.com`).
   - Click the pencil icon to edit the service account.
   - *Add* the following role: `Cloud Run Admin`.
   - Click "Save".

13. Trigger the first build:
    - Go to the [Cloud Build Triggers](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers) page.
    - Click the "Run" button next to the trigger you just created.

    > Alternatively, you can push a commit to the branch you specified in the trigger settings. This will automatically trigger a build.

The build process will automatically:
- Create a Cloud Run service with your specified name if it doesn't exist
- Configure it with public access (allow unauthenticated invocations)
- Enable cold boot capabilities (CPU throttling when idle)
- Set maximum CPU scaling to 3 CPUs

### Manual Deployment
To trigger a manual deployment, run:
```bash
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml
```

## Working with RoboJS Plugins
Use [RoboJS's plugin system](https://robojs.dev/plugins/directory) to add functionality through plugins. Here are some useful plugins:

### Synchronization of State between Clients
Use [@robojs/sync](https://robojs.dev/plugins/sync) to share state in real time between clients.

The `useSyncState` hook creates a state synchronized between clients. The state can be shared across all clients or within a specific subset of clients:
```typescript
import { useSyncState } from '@robojs/sync';

// For state shared across all clients
const [sharedState, setSharedState] = useSyncState<boolean>(false, ['uniqueId']);

// For state scoped to a room (group of clients)
const [roomState, setRoomState] = useSyncState<string>('', ['uniqueId', roomId]);
```

Do not forget to wrap your app with the `SyncContextProvider` as shown [here](https://github.com/guplem/robo-base/blob/sync-web-app/src/app/index.tsx).

> An example implementation of this feature can be found [here](https://github.com/guplem/robo-base/blob/sync-web-app/src/app/modules/counter/Page.tsx).

#### Providing synchronized state to the component tree
You can provide the synchronized state to the component tree using the [React Context API](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext). This enables access to the synchronized state from any component within the tree.

> You can see an example of how to define the context [here](https://github.com/guplem/robo-base/blob/sync-web-app/src/app/modules/counter/Context.ts), how to provide it [here](https://github.com/guplem/robo-base/blob/sync-web-app/src/app/modules/counter/Page.tsx) and how to consume it [here](https://github.com/guplem/robo-base/blob/sync-web-app/src/app/modules/counter/Controls.tsx)

### Scheduling Tasks
Use [@robojs/cron](https://robojs.dev/plugins/cron) to schedule jobs at specific intervals or times.

> Install the plugin with `npx robo add @robojs/cron`.

You can schedule a job to run when your Robo starts by creating `src/events/_start.ts`:
```typescript
import { Cron } from '@robojs/cron';

export default (): void => {
    Cron('*/10 * * * * *', (): void => {
        // This job runs every 10 seconds!
    });
};
```

> The `Cron` constructor returns a job object that can be used to pause, resume, stop, or get the next run time.

See also how to [use a separate file for your job logic](https://robojs.dev/plugins/cron#job-file) and how to [persist jobs across server restarts](https://robojs.dev/plugins/cron#job-file).

> An example implementation of this feature can be found [here](https://github.com/guplem/robo-base/blob/sync-web-app/src/events/_start.ts).

## Working with RoboJS's core features
RoboJS provides a powerful set of features to enhance your application. Note that most core features are only available on the backend (server-side), not in the browser (client-side, e.g., `src/app`).

> Avoid importing from `robo.js` in the frontend. Instead, expose backend functionality via API endpoints.

Some utilities, like the [Logger](https://robojs.dev/robojs/logger), can be used in the browser by importing the subpath:

```typescript
import { logger } from 'robo.js/logger.js';

logger.info('This message is logged from the browser (client)!');
```

For other backend state or features, create API endpoints in `src/api` and fetch them from your frontend. See the [Playground Demo](https://robojs.dev/playground) for examples.

> As discussed [here](https://discord.com/channels/1087134933908193330/1365947805180629022/1366169583198670951), this avoids bundling Node‑specific code into the browser build.

### API
Robo comes bundled with [@robojs/server](https://robojs.dev/plugins/server), a simple server for creating and managing API endpoints.

Creating a new endpoint is as simple as creating a new file in the `src/api` directory. The file name will be used as the endpoint path, and the exported function will handle incoming requests:
```typescript
export default async (request: Request): Promise<Response> => {
    const urlParams: URLSearchParams = new URLSearchParams(request.url.split('?')[1] ?? '');
    const userId: string | null = urlParams.get('userId');

    return new Response(
        JSON.stringify({
            message: 'This is a JSON response',
            userId: userId,
        }),
        {
            status: 200,
        },
    );
};
```

> Multiple example implementations of this feature can be found [here](https://github.com/guplem/robo-base/tree/sync-web-app/src/api).

### Database
Robo comes bundled with [Flashcore Database](https://robojs.dev/robojs/flashcore), a key-value pair database. It is a simple and fast database for storing data accessible from all clients. While not a full-fledged database, it is useful for small amounts of data.

```typescript
import { Flashcore } from 'robo.js';
import type { CommandInteraction } from 'discord.js';

export default async (interaction: CommandInteraction): Promise<string> => {
    const userId: string = interaction.user.id;

    const score: number | undefined = await Flashcore.get<number>(userId);
    return score
        ? `High score is: ${score}!`
        : 'No high score yet! 🎮';
};
```
> An example implementation of this feature can be found [here](https://github.com/guplem/robo-base/blob/sync-web-app/src/api/room.ts).

> **Note:** Flashcore does not persist data outside the container. If the container restarts (e.g., due to cold‑boot), all data is lost. To persist, use a Keyv adapter (MySQL, MongoDB, etc.).

Flashcore also allows [watching for changes](https://robojs.dev/robojs/flashcore#watching-for-changes) in the database with the `Flashcore.on(...)` method, and you can stop watching with `Flashcore.off(...)`.

If it is desired to persist data, Flashcore accepts [Keyv Adapters](https://robojs.dev/robojs/flashcore#using-keyv-adapters), allowing you to use, for instance [MySQL](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/main/packages/mysql) or [MongoDB](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/main/packages/mongo).

### State Management
Use [Robo's state management](https://robojs.dev/robojs/state) to temporarily store data in server (backend) memory. This is useful for storing data that doesn't need to persist across server restarts.

> Alternatively, you can use Flashcore without a Keyv adapter to store data in memory.

#### Client-side State Management
If you need client-side state management you can also use [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) (or any other state management library like Redux, MobX, etc. or simply React's built-in state management: `useState` and `useReducer`).

This is an example of a simple Zustand *store* that manages a counter:
```typescript
import { create } from 'zustand';

type CounterStore = {
  count: number;
  increment: () => void;
};

export const useCounterStore = create<CounterStore>((set): CounterStore => ({
  count: 0,
  increment: (): void => set((state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 })),
}));
```

> Tip: To persist your store across page reloads, use Zustand’s `persist` middleware:

> An example implementation of the store can be found [here](https://github.com/guplem/robo-base/blob/sync-web-app/src/app/modules/room/store.ts) and its usage can be found in many places such as [here](https://github.com/guplem/robo-base/blob/sync-web-app/src/app/modules/room/Page.tsx).

## Other Features
Check out the [RoboJS documentation](https://robojs.dev/) for more information on available [plugins](https://robojs.dev/plugins) and [core features](https://robojs.dev/robojs/overview).

Another useful feature is [Running Mode](https://robojs.dev/robojs/mode), which lets you select the `.env` file to use. This helps separate development, testing, and production configurations.

And many more! **Be sure to explore the available [plugins](https://robojs.dev/plugins) and [features](https://robojs.dev/robojs/overview) in RoboJS.**
